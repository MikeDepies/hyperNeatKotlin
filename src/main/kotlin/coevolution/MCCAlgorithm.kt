// 1. Define a population of candidate solutions and a population of tests.
// 2. Evaluate the performance of each candidate solution against each test.
// 3. Assign a score to each candidate solution based on its performance.
// 4. Use resource limitation to ensure diversity: allocate a fixed amount of resources (e.g., reproduction opportunities) among candidate solutions.
// 5. Distribute resources based on the novelty or uniqueness of the solution, ensuring that resources are not monopolized by a subset of similar solutions.
// 6. Implement minimal criteria for survival: solutions must meet a basic level of performance to be eligible for resources.
// 7. Allow for the evolution of both candidate solutions and tests to promote coevolution and maintain a dynamic and challenging environment.
// 8. Periodically introduce new tests to the population to prevent overfitting and to encourage the development of generalized solutions.
// 9. Implement mechanisms for speciation or niching to further promote diversity within the population of candidate solutions.
// 10. Iterate through the evolutionary process, continuously selecting, reproducing, and mutating candidate solutions and tests, guided by the principles of diversity preservation and minimal criterion coevolution.
